Interestingly, server for frontend and server as backend are two server application. This makes sense in real world but not too much in our toy app.

Though we still do this.

This provides a way of constructing typescript with express

Finally we incorporate `src` directory by changing `tsconfig.json` with
```
  "include": [
    "src"
  ]
```

How the basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app on a database is constructed

However, the functional correspondence is `useQuery` and `useMutation`

## Quick notes on HTML/CSS Styling
* We use `p {}` to apply styling to all `<p></p>`
* We use `#kkk {}` to apply styling to the stuff with id `kkk`
* We use `.navigation {}` to ... to those with class `navigation` e.g. `â€‹<p class="navigation">Go Forward</p>`
* we also can use `p.navigation {}` to the class while with `p`, e.g. above 
* We can also use `a b c {}` as descendant selectors
* to have responsive design (i.e. automatic size adaption), we need to use BootStrap
